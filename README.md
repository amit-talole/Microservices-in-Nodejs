# Node Express & Typescript Starter for 2024

_"A minimally opinionated typescript & express starter for 2024"_

This template is also used by my utility create-my-express on npm.

## Usage:

You should copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and then:


`npm start` - Runs the server.

## Default endpoints:

A `GET` request to `/` will respond with a description of the application.

A `POST` request to `/` will echo any json sent in the request body.

## Help out

Feedback and contributions are very welcome.
